Project Description: Decoding Modern Graphic Design

Decoding Modern Graphic Design is my first hands-on exploration of HTML and CSS, where I focused on learning the basics while diving into creative experimentation. The idea for this project came from three thought-provoking articles about graphic design: "AUTO-TUNE TYPOGRAPHY," "Graphic Design's Factory Settings," and "There Is No Neutral Graphic Design." These readings critique the repetitive patterns and hidden norms in modern graphic design, and I wanted to translate their ideas into a website that felt fresh and meaningful.

The site is all about experimenting with layout and design. I played around with CSS grid and flexbox, testing how I could use them in new ways to structure each page. I also pushed myself to use bold colors—stepping away from the neutral tones of my earlier projects—to give the site a vibrant, dynamic feel. Each article page is designed to reflect the key ideas I took away from the readings, creating distinct identities for each one while ensuring everything remains clear and readable.

The landing page ties it all together, offering a preview of each article along with a simple navigation bar and a colophon where I share insights about my process and inspiration. For me, this project was as much about learning to code as it was about exploring the role of design in communicating big ideas. Decoding Modern Graphic Design is my way of blending curiosity with creativity, making the leap from beginner coding to thoughtful design.
